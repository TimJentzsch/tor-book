# Claiming the Post

Next, you need to claim the post. To do that, open up the post on [r/TranscribersOfReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit).
You will see that there are already a couple of automated comments in the post.

One of them is by [u/transcribersofreddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/transcribersofreddit). This is the bot that automatically adds the posts from the partner subreddits to r/TranscribersOfReddit.
The comment will contain useful information to consider while transcribing, as well as a list of templates for common post types.
Additionally, you might see comments by [u/transcribot](https://www.reddit.com/u/transcribot). This is a bot that uses optical character recognition (OCR) to detect text in the images that you might use for your transcriptions.

To claim the post, simply post `claim` either as a top-level comment or as a reply to the [u/transcribersofreddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/transcribersofreddit) comment.
If this is your first transcription, the bot will reply with our code of conduct.
After you have carefully read it, you can reply with `accept` to finish claiming the post.
You will only have to accept the code of conduct one time only.

Finally, you have to verify that the post was assigned to you.
In some rare cases, it can happen that another transcriber claimed your post while you were reading through the code of conduct.
When you check your inbox or refresh the post, you should see that [u/transcribersofreddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/transcribersofreddit) has replied to your comment to confirm that you claimed the post.
Otherwise, it might say that someone else claimed the post already.
If this is the case, simply go back to the queue and select a new post.
