# Choosing a Post

The first thing you need to do is to choose a post to transcribe.
Go to [r/TranscribersOfReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit) and look through the available posts.
Text-based images such as social media posts are usually the easiest to transcribe and a perfect place to start.

However, you need to make sure to that the post complies to the rules of the partner subreddit.
Most importantly, be weary of personal information (PI) appearing in the images.
A lot of subreddits do not allow any kind of PI, while others allow it only for public figures.
