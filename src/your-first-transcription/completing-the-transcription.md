# Completing the Transcription

Once you are happy with your transcriptions, it's time to submit it.
First, it's a good idea to proofread your post to make sure that everything is spelled exactly like in the original.
Afterwards, you can submit your comment.

The last thing you have to do is to mark your transcription as "done" on [r/TranscribersOfReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit).
To do this, simply comment `done` either as a top level comment or as a reply to the claim confirmation.

[u/transcribersofreddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/transcribersofreddit) should then confirm that your transcription has been registered and change the flair of the post to "Completed".
You will also see that your user flair has changed, you now have one Gamma (Î“) more than before!
This is our internal score system. For every completed transcription you will get one Gamma.
Eventually, your rank will also level up!
