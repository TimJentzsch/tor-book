# Personal Information

Many subreddits explicitly forbid personal information (PI).
Therefore, you have to make sure that the post you are transcribing conforms to the subreddit rules.

Usually, personal information contains anything that can be connected to real people.
This can include usernames, profile pictures, first names, last names, places, etc.
Some subreddits have special rules for public figures or first names.

In general, if you are not sure if something is allowed on the given subreddit, leave it out!

Here is an overview of the rules. Keep in mind that this list might be outdated or incomplete!

### Exceptions

- **Anarchism**: No private personal-identifying information (anti-doxxing rule). It concerns information not retrievable publicly, like phone numbers and street adresses. It could apply also to usernames, so be careful.
- **BestOfReports**: "Try to include context where necessary."
- **insaneparents**: "No identifying information - Verified accounts do not need to be blocked out. They are public figures."
- **ScottishPeopleTwitter**: "Keep personal information to a minimum. Mods reserve the right to remove posts and/or request personal information to be edited out at our own discretion."
- **suicidebywords**: "usernames are fine, but any real names should be removed."
- **TrollXChromosomes**: "Posts about other subreddits, threads, or users are not allowed in TrollX to minimise drama and brigading." - Redacted is not enough, no Reddit posts at all.

### Relevant reddiquette

> Please don’t post someone's personal information, or post links to personal information. This includes links to public Facebook pages and screenshots of Facebook pages with the names still legible. We all get outraged by the ignorant things people say and do online, but witch hunts and vigilantism hurt innocent people too often, and such posts or comments will be removed. Users posting personal info are subject to an immediate account deletion. If you see a user posting personal info, please contact the admins.
