# Emojis

Many social media posts contain emojis.
You should transcribe them exactly how they appear in the image.

A helpful resource to find the emojis is [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/).
If you are on Windows, you can also access an emoji-picker with `Win+.`.
There are also several emoji pickers available as browser add-on.
